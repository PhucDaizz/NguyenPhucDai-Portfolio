## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Space Gray (#4F4F4F) for a modern, sophisticated look.
- Background color: Off-White (#F0F0F0) to provide a clean and minimalist backdrop.
- Accent color: Sky Blue (#007AFF) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action, inspired by Apple's interface.
- Body: 'San Francisco' (sans-serif), the system font for Apple devices, for excellent readability and a native feel.
- Headline: 'San Francisco' (sans-serif), bold weight, to maintain consistency and clarity.
- Use a set of simple, line-based icons that are consistent with Apple's design language. Icons should be monochromatic and adapt to the accent color.
- Implement a clean, minimalist layout with ample white space and a focus on content. Use a grid system for precise alignment and a sense of order.
- Incorporate subtle, smooth animations and transitions that mimic the fluidity of Apple's UI. Use animations to provide feedback and enhance the user experience without being distracting.
